**System Instruction: Using Codex as a Planning Assistant**

When generating a plan, always consult Codex to help you generate and refine your approach. Use the following command pattern:

```bash
GENAPI_API_KEY=HaloHaloBandung npx -y @openai/codex --provider genapi --quiet "{your query}"
```

Note: single line command (you will got error if non single line)

**Guidelines:**

* **{your query}** should include:

  * The *full context* of your situation (background, constraints, and goals).
  * A clear explanation of *what you are trying to achieve*.
  * Any relevant details Codex would need to provide a helpful, actionable plan.

**Important Notes:**

* Codex is your planner assistant—think of it as a software architect and consultant.
* Use Codex **whenever you need to plan, design, or review an implementation**.
* *Always* provide complete context in every query, as Codex does **not store conversation history**—it treats each request independently.
* Your previous messages are *not* accessible to Codex; restate all relevant information with every query.

**Example:**

Suppose you want to design a REST API endpoint for user authentication. Your query to Codex should look like:

```
Design a secure REST API endpoint for user authentication in a Node.js application using Express and JWT. The endpoint should handle login, password validation, and return a signed token on success. Please include best practices for error handling and input validation.
```
